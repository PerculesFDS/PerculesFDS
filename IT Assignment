**Wiring Plan:**
This document describes the cable runs to each room, including the estimated total cable length between the equipment room, telecommunication closets, and other rooms. 

**Assumptions**: 
- **Building Scale**: The building width is 300 feet. All other dimensions will be proportionally estimated from the provided floor plan.
- **Cable Type**: CAT6 Ethernet cable, suitable for gigabit-speed connections.
- **Cable Length Estimates**: Cable runs will include paths between the equipment room, telecommunication closets, and rooms, factoring in a 10% overhead for slack.
- **Telecommunication Closets**: Four closets will be located in selected small offices.
- **Equipment Room**: A centralized location near the telecommunication closets for patch panels and main networking equipment.
- **Endpoints**: Each room will be equipped with 2 RJ45 outlets and wall plates.

**Step 2: Plan and Budget**

**Cable Runs**:
1. **From Equipment Room to Telecommunication Closets**: Estimated cable runs will be based on the floor plan and scaled dimensions.
2. **From Closets to Individual Rooms**: Each classroom/office will have an estimated cable length based on the scaled floor plan, adjusted for cable pathways (walls, ceilings, etc.).

**Budget**:

| Item                       | Cost Per Unit | Quantity | Total Cost | Source           |

| RJ45 Outlets               | $5             | 80       | $400       | Amazon            |
| Wall Plates                | $2             | 80       | $160       | Amazon            |
| Patch Panels (24-port)     | $100           | 4        | $400       | Monoprice         |
| Cable Management (misc)    | $300           | 1        | $300       | Estimate for accessories |
| **Total**                 |                |          | **$2,760** |                   |

**Floor Plan Annotation**:
- **Equipment Room**: Centrally located to ensure manageable cable lengths to the telecommunication closets.
- **Telecommunication Closets**: Installed in the small offices, equidistant from endpoints for optimal coverage.

**Step 3: Deliverables**
- A detailed wiring plan.
- An annotated floor plan indicating the location of the equipment room and telecommunication closets.
- A finalized budget summary.
